I have been back in the MVS area for a couple of months.  While I
was "away" working on unix systems,  Phillips Petroleum and
CONOCO merged.  We are running "our" systems and "their" system
in different LPARs.  We used different data set names for PROCs,
CLISTS, REXX execs,etc.  I found myself having to look at which
data sets were allocated to my TSO logon, or PROCLIBs were being
used by JES, etc.

I wrote a utility that makes finding thing a lot easier.  CSECT
FIND03 needs to be customized for each system.  After FIND03 has
been customized and the utility has been assembled and
link-edited, the FIND, FIND2, UPDATE, and UPDATE2 REXX execs need
to be made available to anyone who would need to use them.

Now all I have to do is enter "find proc someproc".  The program
searches the correct libraries for the system I am using and when
(and if) it finds the member, it takes me directly into SPF
browse.  I don't have to remember which data sets to search.  You
can define any kind of "type" that makes sense for you.  Since
you are taken directly to SPF browse or SPF edit, the data sets
need to be a form that are browse-able or edit-able.

The source code, macros, ASSEMBLY JCL, and same REXX execs are
about 800 lines.  Would you or anyone else be interested in this?
